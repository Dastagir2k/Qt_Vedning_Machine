## Why Qt?

Qt is a powerful and versatile framework for developing cross-platform applications. Here are a few reasons why Qt was chosen for this project:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Qt allows the application to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without changing the source code.
- **Rich UI Capabilities**: Qt provides a wide range of tools and widgets for creating sophisticated and responsive user interfaces.
- **Strong Community and Support**: Qt has a large and active community, along with extensive documentation and support resources.
- **Modular Architecture**: Qt's modular approach allows developers to include only the necessary components, optimizing performance and reducing application size.
- **Ease of Use**: Qtâ€™s comprehensive IDE, Qt Creator, provides a user-friendly environment for designing, coding, and debugging applications.
